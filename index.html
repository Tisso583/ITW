                    Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria,
                    South Africa. His mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a
                    model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised
                    in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a White South
                    African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor,
                    consultant, and property developer who was once a half-owner
                    of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika. Musk has a
                    younger brother, Around age 10, Musk developed an interest
                    in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore
                    VIC-20. He learned computer programming using a manual and,
                    at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he
                    created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine
                    for approximately $500. An awkward and introverted child,
                    Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once
                    hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight
                    of stairs. He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School
                    and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria
                    Boys High School.

                    Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States
                    from Canada, Musk applied for a Canadian passport through
                    his Canadian-born mother. While awaiting the documentation,
                    he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this
                    allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African
                    military.Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with
                    a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs
                    at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, he entered Queen's
                    University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he
                    transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he
                    graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics
                    and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics. In 1994, Musk
                    held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at
                    energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which
                    researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage,
                    and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In
                    1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)
                    program in materials science at Stanford University in
                    California. Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but
                    never received a response to his inquiries. He dropped out
                    of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the
                    Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.

                    In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded
                    web software company Zip2 with funds from angel investors.
                    They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo
                    Alto. The company developed and marketed an Internet city
                    guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps,
                    directions, and yellow pages. Musk says that before the
                    company became successful, he could not afford an apartment
                    and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and
                    showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his
                    brother. When he and Kimbal could not agree on business
                    decisions, they settled their differences through wrestling.
                    According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I
                    was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."
                    The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times
                    and the Chicago Tribune, and persuaded the board of
                    directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.
                    Musk's attempts to become CEO, a position held by its
                    Chairman Rich Sorkin, were thwarted by the board. Compaq
                    acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999, and
                    Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.

                    In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services
                    and e-mail payment company. The startup was one of the first
                    federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months
                    of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service. The
                    company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and had
                    him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the
                    year. The following year, X.com merged with online bank
                    Confinity to avoid competition. Founded by Max Levchin and
                    Peter Thiel, Confinity had its own money-transfer service,
                    PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service. Within
                    the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference
                    for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the
                    company and caused Thiel to resign. Due to resulting
                    technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model,
                    the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in
                    September 2000.Under Thiel, the company focused on the
                    PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. In 2002,
                    PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of
                    which Musk‚Äîthe largest shareholder with 11.72% of
                    shares‚Äîreceived $175.8 million.

                    In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars
                    Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber
                    for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project
                    himself. In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim
                    Cantrell and Mike Griffin to buy refurbished
                    Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send
                    the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies
                    NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a
                    novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief
                    designers. The group returned to the United States
                    empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia
                    to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with
                    Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which
                    Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that
                    could build affordable rockets. With $100 million of his
                    early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies
                    Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002. As of 2021, he remains
                    the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief
                    Engineer. SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1
                    rocket in 2006, and although the rocket failed to reach
                    Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital
                    Transportation Services program contract from NASA later
                    that year. After two more failed attempts, which reportedly
                    caused Musk so much stress that he was "waking from
                    nightmares, screaming and in physical pain," SpaceX
                    succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008,
                    making it the first private liquid-fuel rocket to do so.[82]
                    Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial
                    Resupply Services program contract from NASA for 12 flights
                    of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the
                    International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle
                    after its 2011 retirement. In 2012, the Dragon vehicle
                    berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.
                    Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015,
                    SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9.
                    Landings were later achieved on an autonomous spaceport
                    drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform. In 2018,
                    SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission
                    carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.
                    In 2017, SpaceX unveiled its next-generation launch vehicle
                    and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket, later renamed to
                    Starship, which would support all SpaceX launch service
                    provider capabilities. In 2018, SpaceX announced a planned
                    2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called
                    dearMoon project. In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed
                    flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to
                    place a person into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with
                    the ISS. SpaceX began development of the Starlink
                    constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to
                    provide satellite Internet access, with the first two
                    prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set
                    of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece
                    of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60
                    operational satellites were launched. The total cost of the
                    decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the
                    constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion

                    Tesla, Inc.‚Äîoriginally Tesla Motors‚Äîwas incorporated in July
                    2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed
                    the company until the Series A round of funding.[99] Both
                    men played active roles in the company's early development
                    prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of
                    investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million,
                    became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of
                    directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the
                    company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not
                    deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. Following
                    a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008
                    financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk
                    assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product
                    architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard
                    designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning
                    and two others. As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest
                    tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally. In
                    2021, Musk nominally changed his title to Technoking while
                    retaining his position as CEO. Tesla first built an electric
                    sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500
                    vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric
                    car to use lithium-ion battery cells. Tesla began delivery
                    of its four-door Model S sedan in a cross-over, the Model X
                    was launched in 2015. A mass market sedan, the Model 3, was
                    released in 2017. As of March 2020, it is the world's
                    best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units
                    delivered. A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was
                    launched in 2020. The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup
                    truck, was unveiled in 2019. Under Musk, Tesla has also
                    constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric
                    vehicle subassembly factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in
                    Nevada and Gigafactory 3 in China. Since its initial public
                    offering in 2010. Tesla stock has risen significantly; it
                    became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020, and it
                    entered the S&P 500 later that year. In October 2021 it
                    reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth
                    company to do so in U.S. history. On November 6, 2021, Musk
                    proposed on Twitter selling 10% of his Tesla stock, since
                    "much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of
                    tax avoidance". After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts
                    supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock in
                    the week ending November 12, and a total of $16.4 billion by
                    year end, reaching the 10% target. In February 2022, The
                    Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk
                    were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider
                    trading related to the sale.

                Musk made $165 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002. He
                was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a
                net worth of $2 billion. At the start of 2020, Musk had a net
                worth of $27 billion. By the year's end his net worth had
                increased by $150 billion, largely driven by his ownership of
                around 20% of Tesla stock. During this, Musk's net worth was
                often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in
                September, the largest single-day plunge in the history of the
                Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In November of that year, Musk
                passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the
                third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed
                Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest. In
                January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed
                Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the
                world. Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month. On
                September 27, 2021, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth
                of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world,
                after Tesla stock surged. In November 2021, Musk became the
                first person with a net worth over $300 billion. Around
                three-quarters of Musk's wealth derives from Tesla. Musk does
                not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed in 2018 to a
                compensation plan with the board that ties his personal earnings
                to Tesla's valuation and revenue. The deal stipulated that Musk
                only receives the compensation if Tesla reaches certain market
                values. It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and
                board. In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to
                purchase 1.69 million TSLA shares (about 1% of the company) at
                below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million. Musk
                paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between
                2014 and 2018. According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal
                income taxes in 2018. His 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12
                billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock

                In 2015, Musk stated he was a "significant (though not top-tier)
                donor to Democrats" but that he also gives heavily to
                Republicans. Musk said that political contributions are a
                requirement to have a voice in the United States government.
                Musk criticized Donald Trump for his stance on climate change
                and after joining Trump's two business advisory councils, Musk
                resigned from both in June 2017 in protest against Trump's
                decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.
                In the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Musk endorsed
                candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed
                universal basic income;[293] he endorsed Kanye West's
                independent campaign in the general election. Musk has stated
                that he thinks a theoretical government on Mars should be direct
                democracy. In September 2021, following the adoption of Texas'
                strict abortion restrictions, Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated
                that Musk and SpaceX supported Texas' "social policies". In
                response, Musk stated, "In general, I believe government should
                rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so,
                should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said,
                I would prefer to stay out of politics." Regarding Democratic
                proposals for increased taxes on billionaires, Musk's responses
                have included critical policy remarks and lashing out at
                proponents such as Senator Ron Wyden.

                In July 2020, Musk tweeted
                "Pronouns suck" to significant backlash on Twitter, including
                from his partner Grimes. The tweet has been perceived by some as
                transphobic and an attack on non-binary identities. In a series
                of December 2020 tweets, Musk again mocked the use of pronouns.
                The Human Rights Campaign, which had previously given Tesla the
                number one ranking on its Corporate Equality Index, criticized
                his tweets and called for an apology. 
                </p>
                Musk has stated that he
                does not believe the U.S. government should provide subsidies to
                companies; instead they should use a carbon tax to discourage
                poor behavior. Musk says that the free market would achieve the
                best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly
                vehicles should come with its own consequences. His stance has
                been called hypocritical as his businesses have received
                billions of dollars in subsidies. In addition, Tesla made large
                sums from government-initiated systems of zero emissions credits
                offered in California and the United States federal level, which
                enabled improved initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles, as
                the tax credits given by governments enabled Tesla's battery
                electric vehicles to be price-competitive, in relative
                comparison with existing lower-priced internal combustion engine
                vehicles. Notably, Tesla generates a sizeable portion of its
                revenue from its sales of carbon credits granted to the company,
                by both the European Union Emissions Trading System and the
                Chinese national carbon trading scheme
